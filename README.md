# Planning Center Tech Interview Prep

Congratulations on making it to the tech interview portion of our
hiring process. Without giving too much away, we'll be pairing up on
some tasks together in an app that has the same dependencies and setup
as this app.

In order to make things go smoothly during the interview, we've
prepared this very small application so that you can prepare your
machine for the prerequisites of the actual application we'll be
working on together.

## Install the dependencies

1. This app uses **Ruby 3.2.0**. A recent version of **Node** is also
   required to install `yarn` and the app's javascript dependencies.

1. `bundle install`

1. `yarn install`

## Make sure everything is working

1. `bundle exec rails db:prepare`

1. `bundle exec rails server`

1. Visit http://0.0.0.0:3000 in your browser. If you see both "Rails works!" and "React works!", you are all set!

## HELP!

If you need some extra help getting this working or have any other
questions, please feel free to contact us through whichever form of
communication we've been using with you so far. If you just cannot
get it working before the interview, don't sweat itâ€”we'll help you
through it.
